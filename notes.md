Worked on this all day Sunday - sooo distracted on Friday/Saturday :)

This was fun to work on! I went into a coding vortex, looked away from my screen and it was 8 hours later.

Starting the project gave me a lot of trouble. Wasn't quite sure what needed to be done to set it all up.
However, once I got through that initial hurdle it was smooth sailing.
